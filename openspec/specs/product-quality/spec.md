# product-quality Specification

## Purpose

Define the product invariants that make AIGW verifiable, portable, and
independently publishable without turning presentation preferences or
repository-specific measurements into arbitrary merge vetoes.

## Requirements

### Requirement: one complete quality graph

One quality graph SHALL serve local development, exact-HEAD proof, GitLab, and
GitHub. A declarative topology generates Forge files; repository commands own
behavior and projection drift SHALL fail first. Product targets, artifacts,
native acceptance, and host compatibility SHALL remain distinct claims. Each
admitted event SHALL receive its required graph; cross-event reuse requires an
explicit verifier, and cross-compilation SHALL prove artifacts only.

#### Scenario: a new repository owner is added

- **WHEN** tracked material is added or changed
- **THEN** its semantic class SHALL select every applicable quality check without an exclusion.

#### Scenario: a new package or test owner is added

- **WHEN** tracked Go source changes
- **THEN** architecture, static analysis, formatting, coverage, governance, and cross-platform contracts SHALL evaluate the new owner without an exclusion list.

#### Scenario: a projection diverges

- **WHEN** a tracked Forge file differs from the deterministic projection
- **THEN** source verification SHALL fail with the exact file before expensive tests.

#### Scenario: A required native runner is unavailable

- **WHEN** a Forge lacks an admitted executor for a supported platform
- **THEN** its projection SHALL omit that executor explicitly while aggregate
  product evidence still requires the platform
- **AND** exact-commit native evidence from another admitted executor MAY satisfy
  that platform fact; another operating system or cross-compile SHALL NOT.

#### Scenario: a release asset is cross-compiled

- **WHEN** CI produces an archive for an OS and architecture not represented by that runner
- **THEN** the archive MAY satisfy the release-asset matrix
- **AND** it SHALL NOT be reported as native acceptance or developer-host proof.

#### Scenario: a projection is regenerated

- **WHEN** the CI authority is rendered
- **THEN** every Forge-native file SHALL be produced deterministically
- **AND** no separate parser or duplicated policy SHALL be required.

#### Scenario: A GitLab job uses a toolchain container

- **WHEN** the runner prepares a container-backed verification job
- **THEN** the projected image configuration yields control to the runner shell
- **AND** the image's own entrypoint cannot reinterpret runner shell arguments

#### Scenario: Tests run inside a Forge job

- **WHEN** a test verifies the generic source gate sequence
- **THEN** it is independent of inherited Forge provenance variables
- **AND** dedicated provenance tests supply their own complete inputs

#### Scenario: A required native runner is misconfigured

- **WHEN** its operating-system shell or locked toolchain cannot start
- **THEN** the native gate fails explicitly
- **AND** no cross-build or different operating system is reported as a substitute

#### Scenario: a developer submits a proposal for review

- **WHEN** a proposal targets `dev` through a pull request or merge request
- **THEN** the review head SHA SHALL receive the complete verification graph
- **AND** the proposal branch push SHALL NOT start a parallel copy of that graph.

#### Scenario: a maintainer publishes an accepted product object

- **WHEN** local accepted `main` is projected unchanged to peer `main` and `dev`
- **THEN** the peer SHALL verify each resulting accepted-branch and release-branch
  event for its exact object
- **AND** only the release-branch push SHALL require accepted-ref parity; equal
  object IDs alone SHALL NOT suppress the accepted-branch graph.

#### Scenario: explicit diagnosis is required

- **WHEN** a maintainer explicitly dispatches verification
- **THEN** the selected Forge SHALL run the complete graph for the selected ref.

### Requirement: portable repository text

Tracked text SHALL use deterministic encoding and line-ending semantics across
supported hosts. Repository-owned verification SHALL express host-independent
behavior with one semantic contract on macOS, Linux, and Windows. A test SHALL
not infer a portable I/O failure from POSIX permission bits when the target host
does not implement that permission model.

#### Scenario: a native test proves a filesystem error boundary

- **WHEN** repository verification must exercise a filesystem operation failure
- **THEN** the fixture SHALL construct that failure deterministically on every supported host
- **AND** the same production error path SHALL be asserted without a platform skip

#### Scenario: text contains a byte-level defect

- **WHEN** tracked text contains CR line endings, trailing whitespace, or lacks a final newline
- **THEN** repository quality SHALL report the exact file and line

#### Scenario: a contributor uses another supported host

- **WHEN** the repository is cloned under another operating system, user, directory, or Forge
- **THEN** checkout, verification, build, installation, and release contracts SHALL remain discoverable and executable from repository-owned inputs

#### Scenario: a contributor uses another operating system

- **WHEN** Git checks out tracked text
- **THEN** line endings and executable semantics SHALL remain deterministic

#### Scenario: Native Windows renders the CI projection

- **WHEN** the repository and a test fixture reside on different Windows volumes
- **THEN** CUE SHALL evaluate the CI authority from the selected repository root
- **AND** generated Forge paths SHALL resolve within that root
- **AND** the same focused contracts SHALL pass on macOS, Linux, and Windows

#### Scenario: valid text uses a different readable spacing style

- **WHEN** Markdown or configuration uses semantically valid blank-line spacing
- **THEN** the repository-wide byte checker SHALL not reject it
- **AND** formatters, serializers, and review SHALL retain their own scoped authority

### Requirement: actor-independent contribution policy

The repository SHALL require structured commit messages and trusted signatures
without binding a personal name, email, key, fingerprint, host path, signing
program, or Forge credential in source. Product identity and trust SHALL be
explicit publication inputs; each peer SHALL independently supply only its
transport credential and hosted account verification.

#### Scenario: an admitted team contributor commits

- **WHEN** a commit enters protected product history
- **THEN** its unchanged message, identities, and signature SHALL satisfy the
  explicit product trust policy.

#### Scenario: one Forge is unavailable

- **WHEN** GitLab or GitHub cannot verify or publish
- **THEN** local verification and the other peer SHALL remain independently
  executable and SHALL NOT claim success for the unavailable peer.

### Requirement: faithful quantitative quality evidence

One machine policy SHALL own Go statement coverage, including the aggregate
floor, package observation, comparison, risk, remediation, and review. Every
production package MUST remain visible; measurable packages MUST execute owned
statements with exact ratios, while proven zero-statement packages MUST report
not applicable. Evidence MUST bind raw counts, package, revision, tree,
toolchain, and policy. Statement data SHALL NOT be relabeled as branch coverage.

#### Scenario: quantitative evidence is evaluated

- **WHEN** coverage is admitted for promotion
- **THEN** aggregate statement evidence SHALL be strictly greater than 95
  percent
- **AND** every canonical production package SHALL be present in the same
  complete evidence set
- **AND** every package with measurable statements SHALL remain executed and
  report its exact statement ratio
- **AND** the verdict SHALL be independent of duplicated literals or inferred
  metrics.

#### Scenario: a quantitative boundary or observation contract is not met

- **WHEN** the aggregate ratio is equal to or below the canonical floor, or a
  package with measurable statements is absent or wholly unexecuted, or the
  observation is contradictory or lacks bound raw evidence
- **THEN** local verification, exact-HEAD proof, and hosted CI SHALL fail before
  promotion.

#### Scenario: a package has no statement denominator

- **WHEN** native Go evidence contains zero measured statements, or the package
  has no counters and Go-selected source proves it has no function bodies
- **THEN** the package SHALL remain visible with coverage not applicable
- **AND** it SHALL add neither fabricated statements nor a percentage to the
  aggregate
- **AND** missing, unreadable or mismatched source evidence SHALL fail rather
  than silently exempt a package.

#### Scenario: an unsupported coverage metric is proposed

- **WHEN** the locked language toolchain cannot produce a claimed metric and no
  maintained admitted analyzer owns it
- **THEN** the repository SHALL omit that claim rather than infer, relabel, or
  preserve it through an abandoned dependency.

#### Scenario: statement data is presented as branch evidence

- **WHEN** a result derives a branch claim from a statement-only profile
- **THEN** the evidence SHALL be rejected as semantically invalid.

#### Scenario: a package owns no branches

- **WHEN** a canonical package contains statements but no independently
  measurable branch decisions
- **THEN** the package SHALL remain visible through its exact statement ratio
- **AND** the repository SHALL NOT invent a 100-percent branch ratio.

#### Scenario: aggregate coverage carries the quantitative veto

- **WHEN** a package has a small or volatile denominator while the aggregate
  floor passes
- **THEN** the exact package ratio SHALL remain visible for review
- **AND** the package ratio SHALL NOT independently veto an otherwise valid
  aggregate result.

### Requirement: semantic structure

All code SHALL follow declared semantic topology, dependency direction, naming,
import ownership, and composition roots. Shared behavior belongs to the
smallest stable owner, never a forwarding wrapper, alias-only package, or
copied helper. Size and complexity MAY guide review but MUST NOT gate without a
justified risk model, measurement, false-positive cost, remediation, and
trigger. One machine policy SHALL state this positive contract without
repository-specific merge blacklists.

#### Scenario: structure violates semantic ownership

- **WHEN** production, test, or tool code violates the declared topology,
  dependency direction, composition root, naming, or ownership contract
- **THEN** the architecture gate SHALL fail with the exact semantic violation.

#### Scenario: a heuristic changes

- **WHEN** a size, complexity, nesting, or presentation heuristic is proposed
  as a merge condition
- **THEN** it SHALL remain review evidence unless its risk model, measurement,
  false-positive cost, remediation path, and review trigger are admitted.

#### Scenario: an ordinary provider is added

- **WHEN** an ordinary provider implementation is added below the declared
  provider owner without changing package topology or dependency direction
- **THEN** no repository-shape allowance or threshold change SHALL be required.

#### Scenario: an implementation technique changes

- **WHEN** a bounded change introduces another language, shell carrier, alias,
  adapter, address example, or local path example
- **THEN** that syntax alone SHALL NOT decide merge admission
- **AND** the positive owner, dependency, portability, security, and evidence
  contracts SHALL determine the verdict.

### Requirement: complete delivery evidence

Quality completion SHALL require distinct evidence for local gates, exact-HEAD
proof, native CI, independent peer publication, branch and tag identity,
asset integrity, installation, runtime acceptance, and housekeeping. A release
SHALL be complete only when its signed tag, immutable assets, checksums, peer
records, and platform acceptance pass at their owners. Each peer SHALL
verify its objects and assets; admitted executors MAY supply native evidence
without weakening platform requirements.

#### Scenario: both publication planes complete

- **WHEN** GitLab and GitHub independently publish one accepted product release
- **THEN** their commit and annotated tag object identifiers SHALL equal local
  Git exactly
- **AND** their asset manifests and supported-platform semantics SHALL agree.

#### Scenario: local proof passes but delivery is incomplete

- **WHEN** hosted CI, a selected peer, exact object identity, asset integrity,
  installation, runtime acceptance, or lane retirement remains unverified
- **THEN** the repository SHALL report that stage as incomplete and SHALL NOT
  claim terminal completion.

#### Scenario: terminal closeout succeeds

- **WHEN** every delivery stage passes for the exact accepted product object
  and obsolete lanes, policies, compatibility paths, temporary assets, and
  stale runtime residue are retired
- **THEN** the repository MAY report completion with receipts for each
  independent boundary.

#### Scenario: release metadata exists without publication

- **WHEN** `VERSION` and `CHANGELOG` name a release but either selected peer
  lacks its exact signed tag object, Release record, or assets
- **THEN** delivery SHALL remain incomplete.

### Requirement: Independent Forge parity

GitLab and GitHub SHALL be independent projections of one local Git object
authority. For every newly published product branch and formal release, local
Git and each selected peer SHALL expose the exact same commit OID, annotated tag
object OID, peeled commit, and tree. Tree-only equality, provider-qualified tag
namespaces, identity replay, and commit maps SHALL NOT be accepted as parity.

#### Scenario: Equivalent provider projection

- **WHEN** one signed local commit or annotated tag is published to both peers
- **THEN** the complete object identity SHALL be exactly equal on local Git,
  GitLab, and GitHub.

#### Scenario: Real source drift

- **WHEN** a peer commit or tag has an equal tree but a different object OID
- **THEN** synchronization SHALL fail as real product-object drift.

### Requirement: Portable exact-version CI bootstrap

GitLab Linux bootstrap SHALL consume the exact mise image version and digest
from the CUE authority and install the declared tool closure from repository
locks. Native distribution clients SHALL own transport and bounded failure
handling; the repository SHALL NOT retain a second installer, force an
incidental HTTP version, or invent a mirror-package requirement.

#### Scenario: Transient HTTP transport failure

- **WHEN** an installer or asset transfer encounters a transient transport error
- **THEN** the native distribution client may retry within its bounded policy
- **AND** unresolved transport or integrity failure stops the job without
  claiming bootstrap success or substituting an unverified tool
- **AND** a retry retains the selected lock and integrity requirements.

### Requirement: Forge capability projection

One product evidence graph and deterministic CI topology SHALL separate product
evidence from each Forge's executor capacity. A Forge projection MUST contain
only native jobs it can run, while aggregate evidence retains every supported
platform. Missing capacity on one Forge MUST NOT create optional, indefinitely
pending, or `allow_failure` substitutes, weaken product support, or let
cross-compilation stand in for native evidence.

#### Scenario: one Forge lacks a Windows executor

- **WHEN** another independent publication plane supplies admitted native Windows evidence
- **THEN** the Forge without Windows capacity SHALL omit its Windows job
- **AND** the product evidence model SHALL continue to require Windows
- **AND** cross-compilation SHALL NOT be reported as native evidence.

#### Scenario: Windows capacity is admitted later

- **WHEN** GitLab gains a qualified Windows executor
- **THEN** one capability declaration SHALL restore the generated native Windows job
- **AND** no parallel workflow or compatibility switch SHALL be introduced.

### Requirement: Source acceptance precedes delivery completion

Source acceptance SHALL require valid official Change artifacts, exact-source
quality evidence, and authorized object-preserving integration. An active
Change MAY reach accepted or release refs while delivery remains incomplete;
its original tasks SHALL retain that work until outcomes are observed. Archive
SHALL follow completed obligations and SHALL NOT gate enabling integration.
Native OpenSpec validation SHALL remain the sole repository lifecycle check.

#### Scenario: Active Change reaches source verification

- **WHEN** source verification observes an active Change in a work lane,
  proposal, accepted branch or release branch
- **THEN** the same official artifact validation and product quality graph run
- **AND** the presence of its task carrier alone SHALL NOT reject valid source
- **AND** malformed artifacts or failed quality checks still block acceptance
- **AND** source acceptance SHALL NOT mark pending publication, installation or
  cleanup complete.

### Requirement: repository text quality has one mature owner per concern

Portable byte invariants SHALL be declared in `.editorconfig` and verified by a
locked cross-platform EditorConfig implementation. Current product Markdown
SHALL be formatted by Prettier, linted by markdownlint, and checked for explicit
link validity by lychee. Repository-specific analyzers SHALL NOT duplicate
those responsibilities or infer links that an author did not declare.
Immutable OpenSpec archives SHALL remain outside current-document rewriting.

#### Scenario: a current text artifact violates its declared contract

- **WHEN** a tracked text file violates `.editorconfig` or a current Markdown
  file violates the locked formatter, linter, or explicit-link contract
- **THEN** repository verification SHALL reject the exact artifact
- **AND** the responsible mature tool SHALL emit the diagnostic.

### Requirement: Quality coverage has one positive authority

Architecture policy SHALL assign each tracked carrier one semantic owner.
The CI entrypoint and native tool configurations SHALL own executable scopes
covering every applicable format, lint, type, semantic, test, security, and
projection concern. Classification alone SHALL NOT prove execution. Rules SHALL
state positive required shape; exclusions SHALL remain narrow, justified, and
owned by the same authority.

#### Scenario: A tracked carrier is added

- **WHEN** a source, test, configuration, documentation, schema, workflow, or
  release file becomes tracked
- **THEN** architecture classification resolves one responsibility and the
  existing native check scopes cover every applicable concern
- **AND** no file is silently uncovered or governed by competing policies.

#### Scenario: Architecture policy is evaluated

- **WHEN** a policy declares carrier responsibilities and selectors
- **THEN** the architecture gate verifies unique ownership and dependency rules
- **AND** acceptance of check execution requires the separately executed native
  gates, not a duplicate list of check names in that policy.

#### Scenario: A generic checker exists

- **WHEN** a maintained formatter, linter, type, security, dependency, or
  documentation tool covers a required generic concern
- **THEN** the repository uses that tool rather than a custom duplicate
- **AND** retains custom logic only for a documented product invariant.

#### Scenario: A repository npm check executes

- **WHEN** the Go quality gate invokes a formatter, Markdown linter, or OpenSpec
  validator
- **THEN** the locked Node runtime executes its native package script against
  checkout-local dependencies
- **AND** missing dependencies or a nonzero validator exit fail the gate even
  if stdout contains a valid-looking result.

#### Scenario: Native platform source is checked

- **WHEN** native acceptance runs on macOS, Linux, or Windows
- **THEN** the shared Go static-quality policy SHALL execute against that
  host's platform-selected product, tool and test sources before behavioral
  tests and release acceptance
- **AND** a static-check failure SHALL stop those later stages
- **AND** another platform's successful check SHALL NOT substitute for it.

#### Scenario: The complete toolchain is qualified on a native platform

- **WHEN** an operator explicitly selects full native quality
- **THEN** the native entrypoint SHALL execute the existing complete quality
  graph before platform-selected behavioral tests and packaged acceptance
- **AND** each quality command SHALL run once, without a second policy list
- **AND** any failed command SHALL stop all later commands
- **AND** ordinary native acceptance SHALL retain its smaller default path
- **AND** source-signature admission SHALL remain a distinct publication check.

#### Scenario: Quality or release configuration is invalid

- **WHEN** the shared quality command reads golangci-lint or GoReleaser
  configuration
- **THEN** the owning tool's native configuration validator SHALL run before
  source analysis or artifact construction
- **AND** unknown fields, missing input, or a failing validator SHALL fail the
  shared gate even when the file is syntactically valid YAML
- **AND** validation SHALL leave configuration bytes unchanged.

#### Scenario: Markdown configuration is validated before linting

- **WHEN** the shared quality command reads the repository Markdown policy
- **THEN** it SHALL validate options against the CLI schema shipped with the
  locked Markdownlint package and base and override rules against the shipped
  strict built-in-rule schema
- **AND** unknown options or rules, invalid parameter values, multiple YAML
  documents and missing or malformed schema inputs SHALL fail the gate
- **AND** schema references SHALL resolve only from the explicit local inputs,
  without network fetching, copied rule tables or input mutation.

#### Scenario: Current source is scanned for secrets

- **WHEN** the source gate checks credentials in the current checkout
- **THEN** native Gitleaks SHALL scan current regular tracked files, including
  ignored tracked paths, and nonignored untracked files through the existing
  Git inventory
- **AND** path-specific policy and redacted findings SHALL remain effective
- **AND** deleted paths, symlink targets and ignored untracked output SHALL
  remain outside that scope; current-file evidence SHALL NOT imply a history
  scan
- **AND** the scan SHALL preserve source bytes, propagate native failures, and
  reclaim its private input projection after success or failure.

#### Scenario: Markdown sections remain navigable

- **WHEN** current Markdown uses decorative heading punctuation or standalone
  emphasis instead of a section heading
- **THEN** the native Markdown gate SHALL reject the structural defect
- **AND** question headings, emphasized sentences and official OpenSpec
  Goals/Non-Goals labels SHALL remain valid
- **AND** table-column alignment SHALL be checked by the native rule rather
  than a repository-specific parser.

### Requirement: Release transport is independent of CI execution

The existing release publisher SHALL accept local operator execution and CI
execution through the same signed-artifact and source-verification path.
GitLab authentication SHALL select exactly one access token or CI job token
without manufacturing a job identity or exporting a signing private key.

#### Scenario: A local operator publishes to GitLab

- **WHEN** `GITLAB_TOKEN` is supplied and `CI_JOB_TOKEN` is absent
- **THEN** the existing upload and publication commands SHALL use the native
  access-token header for upload, metadata and same-origin asset readback
- **AND** CI job-token execution SHALL retain its native job-token header
- **AND** ambiguous or missing credentials SHALL fail before network access
- **AND** redirects away from the selected authority SHALL strip credentials,
  including when the redirect chain later returns to that authority
- **AND** artifact trust, exact tagged source and complete asset verification
  SHALL remain unchanged.

#### Scenario: Published artifacts are qualified independently

- **WHEN** the operator publishes one accepted, signed artifact matrix to
  selected peers and requests post-publication verification
- **THEN** each peer SHALL download only its own complete artifact set and run
  the same read-only signature, inventory and tagged-provenance verifier
- **AND** hosted verification SHALL require public trust and download access,
  not a signing private key or a new artifact build
- **AND** tag creation SHALL still run source and native-platform checks
- **AND** missing trust, missing assets, checksum mismatch, invalid signatures
  or mismatched source SHALL fail rather than trigger reconstruction
- **AND** source CI, artifact verification and installed-product acceptance
  SHALL retain distinct completion claims.

### Requirement: Release SBOM covers the native binary matrix

The release builder SHALL catalog every emitted native executable through the
locked Syft Go-binary and file catalogers. It SHALL retain platform-specific
dependencies and file digests in one SPDX document without a custom SBOM merger.

#### Scenario: Native release evidence is constructed

- **WHEN** the portable release matrix is built
- **THEN** native conformance SHALL compare every SBOM binary path and SHA-256
  with the emitted executable matrix
- **AND** a missing or extra binary count SHALL fail before release signing
- **AND** a single selected binary or a scan of compressed archives SHALL NOT
  establish complete platform coverage
- **AND** full-lock license and vulnerability evidence SHALL remain distinct
  from the binary runtime inventory.

### Requirement: Dependency evidence binds the selected lockfiles

The release scanner invocation and report admission SHALL share one exact
lockfile-path selection. Normalization SHALL admit every selected lockfile
exactly once with nonempty package observations before writing either report.

#### Scenario: Scanner output does not establish the selected scope

- **WHEN** an OSV report is empty, partial, duplicated, attributed to another
  checkout or source kind, or lacks package observations
- **THEN** release construction SHALL fail before evidence signing
- **AND** neither normalized report SHALL be written
- **AND** accepted output SHALL remain unchanged and temporary construction
  state SHALL be reclaimed.

### Requirement: Quantitative policy is evidence-derived

Complexity, executable lines, nesting, parameters, coverage, performance, and
test-size thresholds SHALL derive from the risk they protect and the observed
repository distribution. A threshold SHALL include its scope, rationale,
comparison semantics, review condition, and remediation path.

#### Scenario: A threshold changes

- **WHEN** maintainers tighten or relax a quantitative limit
- **THEN** the change records measured evidence and the protected failure mode
- **AND** does not treat a lower number as intrinsically better.

#### Scenario: Multiple rules report one declaration

- **WHEN** independent native rules find violations at the same source line
- **THEN** the Go quality command SHALL retain each rule's diagnostic
- **AND** a combined trial SHALL NOT count a line-deduplicated report as a
  complete per-rule inventory.

#### Scenario: Package evidence cannot be written

- **WHEN** coverage reporting cannot write a measured, zero-statement or
  declaration-only package observation
- **THEN** the gate SHALL fail and preserve the output error
- **AND** it SHALL reclaim its temporary coverage profile without reporting
  successful aggregate acceptance.

### Requirement: Warnings are owned failures

Every repository-owned warning emitted by a supported build, test, analysis,
documentation, packaging, or CI path SHALL be resolved at its semantic owner.

#### Scenario: A supported gate emits a warning

- **WHEN** the warning is attributable to repository source or configuration
- **THEN** the gate fails until the cause is removed
- **AND** a blanket filter, baseline, or ignored exit code is not accepted as
  the repair.

#### Scenario: Native validation distinguishes advice from failure

- **WHEN** OpenSpec reports a complete successful validation with only `INFO`
  findings
- **THEN** the gate succeeds and displays every informational finding
- **AND** `WARNING`, `ERROR`, a failed summary, unknown severity or malformed
  evidence still fails admission
- **AND** a diagnostic output failure remains an execution failure.

### Requirement: Terminal layout follows semantic fields and display width

Human output SHALL use one presentation owner for terminal-cell measurement,
ANSI-aware layout, wrapping, and aligned semantic fields. Groups stack when
content cannot fit; metadata SHALL own executable names and pflag SHALL own
option grammar. Color SHALL NOT alter alignment. Machine, helper, and interactive
contracts SHALL remain unchanged. Copyable commands SHALL preserve characters,
whitespace, and logical lines; only explanatory text MAY wrap, without adding
shell syntax.

#### Scenario: Copy an executable command from a narrow terminal

- **WHEN** an executable example or follow-up command exceeds the terminal width
- **THEN** its output SHALL preserve the command bytes apart from presentation
  indentation, optional styling and the final output newline
- **AND** neither quoted whitespace nor argument tokens SHALL be rewritten to
  satisfy an explanatory-text width rule.

#### Scenario: Starting commands have different lengths

- **WHEN** root help presents the setup, selection and readiness journey
- **THEN** command and explanation SHALL be distinct fields with one description
  column derived from the group's longest label
- **AND** a renamed root command SHALL propagate without hard-coded product text.

#### Scenario: A terminal is narrow or a value spans multiple lines

- **WHEN** human output contains long labels, unbroken values or multiple lines
- **THEN** the renderer SHALL retain text and continuation indentation within the
  available display width and use stacked rows where necessary
- **AND** colored and plain output SHALL preserve the same layout.

#### Scenario: Inspect the complete public command tree

- **WHEN** every public command renders help at supported narrow and wide widths
- **THEN** headings, descriptions, usage grammar and options SHALL fit those widths
- **AND** native option meaning and credential-free help SHALL remain intact.
