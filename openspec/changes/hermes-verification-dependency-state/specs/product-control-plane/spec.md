# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Hermes verification excludes unrelated update services

When AIGW verifies an enabled Hermes Client Binding, it SHALL invoke the native
client against the selected Route without requiring the client's upstream
software-update service. The disposable verification environment SHALL preserve
the operator's Hermes configuration and credentials, and version-probe failures
SHALL be classified without exposing raw vendor output or private paths. When
the configured Hermes home's data root holds the installation's committed
dependency environment and managed tools, the disposable environment SHALL
reuse that installation state without installing, synchronizing, rebuilding,
or republishing any of it.

#### Scenario: Vendor update service is unavailable

- **WHEN** the selected inference endpoint is healthy but the Hermes software
  update service is unavailable
- **THEN** AIGW can observe the native client version and complete one bounded
  request for the selected Model without contacting the update service
- **AND** no user's Hermes configuration or credential is changed.

#### Scenario: Hermes version probe fails

- **WHEN** the native Hermes version probe times out or exits unsuccessfully
- **THEN** verification fails with the corresponding cause category
- **AND** it does not report successful inference, retry the probe, prompt for
  credentials, or disclose raw stderr, Token material, or private paths.

#### Scenario: Hermes keeps installation state under its data root

- **WHEN** the installed Hermes resolves its committed dependency environment
  and managed tools from the data root of the configured Hermes home
- **THEN** AIGW observes the native client version and completes one bounded
  request from a disposable home that reuses that installation state
- **AND** verification refuses on-demand installation, so the shared
  dependencies, tools, and launchers are not synchronized or republished
- **AND** removing the disposable home leaves the operator's Hermes
  configuration, installation state, and launchers unchanged.

#### Scenario: Installation state cannot be shared

- **WHEN** the host refuses to expose the configured home's installation state
  to the disposable home
- **THEN** verification fails before starting Hermes
- **AND** it does not provision another dependency environment, retry, or
  disclose private paths.
