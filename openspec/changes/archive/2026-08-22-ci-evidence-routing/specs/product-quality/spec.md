## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: one complete quality graph

The repository SHALL expose one logical quality graph reused by local
development, exact-HEAD governance proof, GitLab CI, and GitHub Actions. One
declarative topology authority SHALL generate every Forge-native CI file.
Generated files SHALL NOT own policy. Executable behavior SHALL remain in
repository-owned commands. Projection drift SHALL fail before other source
gates. Product targets, release assets, native acceptance, and developer-host
compatibility SHALL be distinct claims. Cross-compilation SHALL prove only
asset production and SHALL NOT substitute for native execution evidence. Each
Forge SHALL execute the complete verification graph at most once for one
product commit in one lifecycle stage.

#### Scenario: a new repository owner is added

- **WHEN** tracked material is added or changed
- **THEN** its semantic class SHALL select every applicable quality check without an exclusion.

#### Scenario: a new package or test owner is added

- **WHEN** tracked Go source changes
- **THEN** architecture, static analysis, formatting, coverage, governance, and cross-platform contracts SHALL evaluate the new owner without an exclusion list.

#### Scenario: a projection diverges

- **WHEN** a tracked Forge file differs from the deterministic projection
- **THEN** source verification SHALL fail with the exact file before expensive tests.

#### Scenario: A required native runner is unavailable

- **WHEN** a required macOS, Linux, or Windows native job cannot execute
- **THEN** CI SHALL report the missing evidence within a bounded interval
- **AND** no other Forge result or cross-compile SHALL substitute for the native check.

#### Scenario: a release asset is cross-compiled

- **WHEN** CI produces an archive for an OS and architecture not represented by that runner
- **THEN** the archive MAY satisfy the release-asset matrix
- **AND** it SHALL NOT be reported as native acceptance or developer-host proof.

#### Scenario: a projection is regenerated

- **WHEN** the CI authority is rendered
- **THEN** every Forge-native file SHALL be produced deterministically
- **AND** no separate parser or duplicated policy SHALL be required.

#### Scenario: A GitLab job uses a toolchain container

- **WHEN** the runner prepares a container-backed verification job
- **THEN** the projected image configuration yields control to the runner shell
- **AND** the image's own entrypoint cannot reinterpret runner shell arguments

#### Scenario: Tests run inside a Forge job

- **WHEN** a test verifies the generic source gate sequence
- **THEN** it is independent of inherited Forge provenance variables
- **AND** dedicated provenance tests supply their own complete inputs

#### Scenario: A required native runner is misconfigured

- **WHEN** its operating-system shell or locked toolchain cannot start
- **THEN** the native gate fails explicitly
- **AND** no cross-build or different operating system is reported as a substitute


#### Scenario: a developer submits a proposal for review

- **WHEN** a proposal targets `dev` through a pull request or merge request
- **THEN** the review head SHA SHALL receive the complete verification graph
- **AND** the proposal branch push SHALL NOT start a parallel copy of that graph.

#### Scenario: a maintainer publishes an accepted product object

- **WHEN** local accepted `main` is projected unchanged to peer `main` and `dev`
- **THEN** the peer SHALL verify the `main` publication
- **AND** the equal `dev` projection SHALL NOT start another copy of the graph.

#### Scenario: explicit diagnosis is required

- **WHEN** a maintainer explicitly dispatches verification
- **THEN** the selected Forge SHALL run the complete graph for the selected ref.
