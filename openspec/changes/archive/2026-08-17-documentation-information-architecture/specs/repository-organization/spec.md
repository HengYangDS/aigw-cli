## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Semantic documentation architecture

Repository documentation SHALL use one global entry point and SHALL organize
content by semantic information domain. Document filenames SHALL identify their
subject. Container-named local indexes SHALL exist only when they own navigation
or classification semantics not already owned by the global entry point or a
content-bearing register.

#### Scenario: Reader enters the documentation

- **WHEN** a reader starts at `docs/README.md`
- **THEN** the entry point SHALL expose task-oriented paths and the complete
  information-domain map
- **AND** every canonical document SHALL be reachable from that map or a named
  semantic register.

#### Scenario: A document has a single semantic owner

- **WHEN** a document describes architecture, concepts, decisions, evidence,
  experience, governance, guidance, or operations
- **THEN** its directory and filename SHALL identify that owner
- **AND** no compatibility copy or redirect-only document SHALL remain.

#### Scenario: A directory contains multiple documents

- **WHEN** a semantic directory gains another document
- **THEN** file count alone SHALL NOT require a local `README.md`
- **AND** navigation SHALL remain with the smallest content-bearing owner.

#### Scenario: A repository gate consumes a semantic register

- **WHEN** a quality gate validates a documentation register
- **THEN** it SHALL consume the register's semantic filename
- **AND** it SHALL NOT require a container-named compatibility carrier.
