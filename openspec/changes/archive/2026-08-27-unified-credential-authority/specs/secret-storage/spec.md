## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: One backend owns credential persistence

AIGW SHALL select exactly one credential backend for an invocation. The same
backend SHALL own API Tokens and provider-diagnostic credentials in distinct
typed slots, and AIGW SHALL NOT read or write another backend as a
compatibility fallback.

#### Scenario: Automatic selection remains stable

- **WHEN** AIGW automatically selects a writable backend
- **THEN** it records that selection in AIGW-owned state
- **AND** later invocations reuse the same backend for every credential purpose

#### Scenario: Credential purposes remain isolated

- **WHEN** one Account has an API Token and a provider-diagnostic credential
- **THEN** each value is read, replaced, and deleted through its own typed slot
- **AND** an operation on one purpose SHALL NOT change the other

#### Scenario: Environment storage is explicit and read-only

- **WHEN** the operator selects the environment backend
- **THEN** AIGW reads only documented Account credential environment variables
- **AND** refuses credential writes and deletes

#### Scenario: Environment Account names cannot collide

- **WHEN** two valid Account IDs differ by dot, dash, or underscore
- **THEN** AIGW derives distinct deterministic environment variable names
- **AND** the mapping identifies the original lowercase Account ID without an
  ambiguous normalization rule

#### Scenario: Diagnostic environment credential is incomplete

- **WHEN** only the diagnostic system token or only the diagnostic user ID is
  present for an Account
- **THEN** AIGW treats the provider-diagnostic credential as unavailable
- **AND** never substitutes the Account API Token or another backend

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: One backend owns Account Token persistence

**Reason**: Backend authority now covers every AIGW credential purpose, not
only API Tokens.

**Migration**: Use the new `One backend owns credential persistence`
requirement; existing API Token slots remain unchanged.
