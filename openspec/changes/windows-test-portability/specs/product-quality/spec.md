## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: portable repository text

Tracked text SHALL use deterministic encoding and line-ending semantics across
supported hosts. Repository-owned verification SHALL express host-independent
behavior with one semantic contract on macOS, Linux, and Windows. A test SHALL
not infer a portable I/O failure from POSIX permission bits when the target host
does not implement that permission model.

#### Scenario: a native test proves a filesystem error boundary

- **WHEN** repository verification must exercise a filesystem operation failure
- **THEN** the fixture SHALL construct that failure deterministically on every supported host
- **AND** the same production error path SHALL be asserted without a platform skip

#### Scenario: text contains a byte-level defect

- **WHEN** tracked text contains CR line endings, trailing whitespace, or lacks a final newline
- **THEN** repository quality SHALL report the exact file and line

#### Scenario: a contributor uses another supported host

- **WHEN** the repository is cloned under another operating system, user, directory, or Forge
- **THEN** checkout, verification, build, installation, and release contracts SHALL remain discoverable and executable from repository-owned inputs

#### Scenario: a contributor uses another operating system

- **WHEN** Git checks out tracked text
- **THEN** line endings and executable semantics SHALL remain deterministic

#### Scenario: Native Windows renders the CI projection

- **WHEN** the repository and a test fixture reside on different Windows volumes
- **THEN** CUE SHALL evaluate the CI authority from the selected repository root
- **AND** generated Forge paths SHALL resolve within that root
- **AND** the same focused contracts SHALL pass on macOS, Linux, and Windows

#### Scenario: valid text uses a different readable spacing style

- **WHEN** Markdown or configuration uses semantically valid blank-line spacing
- **THEN** the repository-wide byte checker SHALL not reject it
- **AND** formatters, serializers, and review SHALL retain their own scoped authority
