# Changelog

All notable, user-relevant changes are recorded here.  This chronicle follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and Semantic
Versioning.  A published section must correspond to an existing Git tag; it is
not a plan, a branch name, or an inferred version.  Artifact publication,
platform acceptance, signing, and GA status remain separate evidence.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Standardize the repository's user-facing commands, diagnostics, examples,
  documentation, and release metadata on English-only canonical text.
- Simplify the public documentation set around portable installation, explicit
  control-plane boundaries, and reproducible source-checkout verification.
- Record branch closeout as a release-governance requirement: after merge, the
  source worktree and branch are removed once reachability and cleanliness are
  proven.

### Fixed

- Remove repository-specific release endpoints from source builds. Published
  artifacts now receive their release host and project at build time; source
  builds fail closed until both are configured explicitly.
- Enforce the English-only canonical-surface rule for tracked text, including
  test fixtures, through the governance gate.

## [0.1.0-rc.48] - 2026-07-14

### Security

- Require every tag pipeline to verify that its exact annotated release tag carries an SSH signature trusted by the repository-owned signer anchor before packaging, publication, or GitLab Release creation. An unsigned or untrusted tag now fails closed.
